# Keep raw data if needed? Backend needs acts.json or TSV. 
# If they are large, maybe we should mount them instead of copying?
# For now, let's exclude the huge archive if it's not strictly code.
# But analyze_act_by_id needs data. 
# Implementation Plan says acts/research/archive/docs_en.tsv.
# If that file is huge, the build will be slow.
# Let's assume for now we keep the data but ignore git and node_modules which are the usual culprits.
