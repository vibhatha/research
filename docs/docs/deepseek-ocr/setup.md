# Setup

We provide automated scripts to set up the Conda environment and dependencies (including `torch`, `vllm`, and `DeepSeek-OCR`).

## V2 Library Setup (Recommended)

1.  **Run Setup Script**:
    ```bash
    ./setup_v2.sh
    ```
    This creates the `deepseek-ocr-v2` environment and installs the package.

2.  **Initialize Environment**:
    ```bash
    source init_v2.sh
    ```
