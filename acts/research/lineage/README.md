# Act Version Lineage

This folder contains automatically generated Mermaid diagrams that visualise the version history of each Sri Lankan legal act (original act and its amendments). The diagrams are interactive – clicking on a node opens the corresponding English PDF.

## Navigation

- **Year‑wise view** – open [`index.md`](index.md) to browse all acts grouped by the year they were enacted.
- **Alphabetical view** – the same `index.md` also provides an alphabetical list of all acts.
- **Individual act** – click any act name in the lists to see its Mermaid diagram.

The files are generated by `generate_lineage.py` and use clean hyphen‑separated filenames (e.g., `national-audit.md`).
